# DebloatWindowsPersonal
Just a fun way of learning some C. Feel free to add changes.


Tweaks taken from CTT WinUtil, shout out to Chris on his amazing tool.

This executable simply runs the tweaks and changes I want from Chris's WinUtil without having to manually select them.

If you want to compile this yourself:
 run "clang debloat.c modules/tweaks.c modules/setManual.c modules/disableFeatures.c modules/uninstallApps.c -o Debloat.exe" in the directory of the repo.
